The Monkeys and The Cap Seller 

<br />
Once,
 a cap seller was passing through a jungle. He was very tired and needed
 to rest. Then, he stopped and spread a cloth under a tree. He placed 
his bag full of caps near him and lay down with his cap on his head. The
 cap seller had a sound sleep for one hour. When he got up, the first 
thing he did was to look into his bag. He was startled when he found all
 his caps were not there.<br /><br /> 
            When he looked up the sky, he was very surprised to see 
monkeys sitting on the branches of a tree, each of the monkeys is 
wearing a cap of on its head. They had evidently done it to imitate himHe
 decided to get his caps back by making a humble request to the monkeys.
 In return, the monkeys only made faces of him. When he begun to make 
gesture, the monkeys also imitated him.<br /><br /><br />
At
 last he found a clever idea. " Monkeys are a great imitator," he 
thought. So he took off his own cap and threw it down on the ground. And
 as he had expected, all the monkeys took off the caps and threw the 
caps down on the ground. Quickly, he stood up and collected the caps, 
put them back into his bag and went away.<br /><br />The Generic Structure of above Narrative Story Is :<br /><br />Orientation: The
 cap seller as the participant (main character), once time as time 
setting, and in the jungle as place setting. We note from discussion 
that the elements of orientation is shortly answering who, when and 
where of the story.Complication: The
 cap seller wants the monkeys to bring back his caps but the monkeys do 
not return them. Of course this makes the cap seller face a problem. 
Complication in a narrative text is not always in single problem. That 
is we know a major conflict and minor conflict.Resolution: The
 cap seller gets the monkey to bring back the cap by acting of throwing 
his own cap. The monkeys imitate what he has done so the problem is is 
solved. This story has happy ending as the cap seller has his caps 
returned.<br /><br />

So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br /><br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once.

So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br /><br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures.

The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."<br />

They got married and lived happily.<br /><br />Once upon a  time, there lived an unhappy young girl with her stepmother and two step sisters who didn't like her. All the nice things, kind thought and loving touches were for her own daughters. But, for the poor unhappy girl, there was nothing at all. For she had to work hard all day, and only when evening came was she allowed to sit for a while by the fire, near the cinders. That is how she got her nickname, for everybody called her Cinderella.<br /><br />It was quite true. Cinderella, even dressed in rags with a dusty gray face from the cinders, was a lovely girl. While her stepsisters, no matter how splendid and elegant their clothes, were still clumsy, lumpy, and ugly.<br /><br />One day, a ball was to be held by the royal family of the kingdom to find the prince's spouse. Cinderella's stepsisters ordered beautiful new dress for the ball. Cinderella wanted to go to the ball but her stepmother asked her to stay at home.<br /><br />"You? My dear girl, you're staying at home to wash the dishes, scrub the floor and turn down the beds for your stepsisters. They will come home tired and very sleepy." asked her stepmother.<br /><br />Cinderella only nodded her head and began to work. Suddenly something amazing happened. In the kitchen, where Cinderella was sitting all by herself, there was a burst of light and a fairy appeared.<br /><br />"Don't be afraid Cinderella, I know what you feel, my dear. Do you want to go to ball?" asked the fairy.<br /><br />"Yes, I do. But look! How can I go to the ball with this dress? Cinderella replied.<br /><br />Then the fairy turned Cinderella's dress became the most beautiful dress and with beautiful slippers, the loveliest ever seen in the realm. The fairy also turned a pumpkin into a parking coach and turned the mice become six white horses.<br /><br />"Now, you can go to the Court and go to the ball. But remember my dear Cinderella, you must leave the ball at midnight and come home. For that is when the spell ends. Your coach will turn back into a pumpkin, the horses will become mice and you will be dressed again in rags with clogs.<br /><br />At the ballroom, Cinderella amazed everybody there include the prince. When the prince set eyes on Cinderella, he was stuck by her beauty. Walking over to her, he bowed deeply and asked her to dance. Cinderella had a wonderful time at the ball. But, all of a sudden, she heard the sound of a clock, the first stroke of midnight.<br /><br />Remembered what the fairy had said, Cinderella ran back to the coach and went home. But he lost one of her slippers in ballroom. The prince who was now madly in love with her, picked up her slipper and would search for the girl whose foot fitted with the slipper.<br /><br />In the next morning, the prince began to search everywhere in the kingdom but no girl whose foot fitted with the slipper. Until he found Cinderella house and asked Cinderella's stepsisters to wear the slipper. But none fitted with the slipper. The prince began hopeless.<br /><br />"Is there any girl else here" Asked the prince.<br /><br />"Yes, there are. But she is very ugly and I think she is not the girl that you are looking for." replied Cinderella's stepmother.<br /><br />"Call her here!" Asked the prince.<br /><br />Then Cinderella's stepmother called Cinderella to come out who was dressed in rags and wore clogs like usual.

                        Aladdin and the Magic LampOnce upon a time, there lived a handsome boy in Baghdad. The name was Aladdin. He was a clever boy, but he did not like to work.<br /><br />One day Aladdin’s mother sent him to the market place to look for a job. In the market he met a magician. The magician asked him to work together with him. If Aladdin could do, he would get a lot of gold coins and jewellery. The magician asked Aladdin to go inside the cave and find a magical lamp there. He also gave a ring and said, “If you are in any trouble, rub this ring and a genie will come to your rescue!”<br /><br />Aladdin went into the cave. Inside the cave, Aladdin was surprised by what he saw. Every corner was full of gold and treasures. A few minutes later, he found the lamp and quickly returned to the entrance of the cave. Aladdin called out, “Magician, I have found the lamp.” “Excellent,” answered the magician. “Quick, pass it to me!”<br /><br />Aladdin did not trust the magician so he said, “Not so fast Magician. You must help me out of this cave first.”<br /><br />The magician became very angry. When Aladdin was walking to the entrance, the magician pushed a huge rock over the entrance of the cave and left Aladdin and the lamp behind. Aladdin tried to move the rock all by himself, but it was too big and heavy, “Oh no! I am trapped in the cave!” he cried.<br /><br />Suddenly, he remembered the magic ring. He rubbed it with the palm of his hand. To his surprise, a genie appeared before him and in a powerful voice said, “Master, I am the Genie of the ring. How can I help you?”<br /><br />Aladdin was frightened, but he soon found the courage to ask, “Could you please send me back to my house?” In no time at all Aladdin was back home.<br /><br />Aladdin took out the lamp. He wondered what would happen if he rubbed it. As Aladdin was rubbing it, all of a sudden another enormous genie stood before him. The genie of the lamp said, “Master, your wish is my command.” Aladdin was very excited and wished for an enormous palace and bags full of gold.<br /><br />One day, a beautiful princess was passing by Aladdin’s palace. She stopped to talk to Aladdin and soon they became good friends. Before long, Aladdin and Jasmine fell in love each other. She married Aladdin and lived happily.<br /><br />Questions :<br />1. What is the type of the text?<br />2. What is the text about?<br />3. What is the purpose of the text?<br />4. What kind of generic structure will you find in the text?<br />5. What is the main idea of second paragraph?<br />6. What's in the magic lamp Aladdin asked?<br />7. What is given by the magician to Aladdin?<br />8. "He wondered what would happen if he rubbed it." (8th paragraph). What does the underlined word refer to?<br />9. "The name was Aladdin.

They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?" The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."<br />Moral of the Story- A true friend in need is a friend indeed.<br /><br />Hope it helps:)<br />
