                                            B. How to Weld Iron1. Gather your materials. You should have a welding machine, electrode holder with lead, groundclamp with lead, electrodes, and metal to be welded."2. Put on your safety gear. This includes a welding helmet, welding jacket or cotton sweatshirt,pants without cuffs, work boots, gloves, and safety glasses. 33. Prepare the area to be welded in. Remove all flammable material and find a good surfaceto weld on.t4. Set up the machine. Most welding machines are fairly straight forward. You should mostlikely be using an amperage of around 90-120 amps, although this should be adjusted formetal thickness and electrode diameter.5. Use the correct electrode. You should select the electrode appropriate for AC or DC welding,depending on your machine. Make sure the electrodes are dry.6. Clean the metal before welding. This can be done by brushing the surface(s) to be weldedwith a wire brush or a grinder. Remove as much rust or paint from the metal as possible.7. Set the joint. Use clamps and vises to ensure that the joint you are welding is precisely andfirmly held together.8. Strike a welding arc. This is accomplished by tapping the metal and quickly pulling up orstriking it like a match. You are completing the circuit and pulling away, which causes theelectricity to jump from the electrode to the metal.9. Build up a weld pool. When a stable arc can be maintained, ignore the end of the electrodeand instead watch the pool of molten metal.10. Start moving the weld pool across the metal. Keep the electrode at an angle a few degreesshy of 90°11. Finish the weld. Pull the electrode back from the metal and allow it a few seconds to cool.The metal will still be very hot at this point, but it should no longer be red hot.12. Clean the slag. Slag is a residue left from the welding process. During the weld, the slagprotects the hot metal from contaminants.13. Examine the weld. A welder's first welds are often poor and do not take stress well. However,practice changes this. Make another pass to fix any gaps or incomplete welds.14. Allow the metal to cool. Cooling in water will make the weld brittle, so allow any structuralwelds to cool by air instead.​ </a>

                                            As  the  teacher  brought  the  class  back  from  the  washroom,  he  noticed that  Alvin  and  Elijah  were nowhere  to  be  seen.  He  asked  the  class,  "Has  anyone  seen  Alvin  or  Elijah?"  Most  of  the  students confirmed that they had not seen them, except for Rodney, who remained silent while tapping his foot on the floor anxiously. The teacher noticed this. "Rodney, do  you happen  to know where  your best buddies  Alvin  and  Elijah  went?"  Rodney  looked  away  and  said,  "Nah,  I  haven't  seen  them."  The teacher notified the office of the missing students. An announcement was made over the PA system and a few minutes later, Alvin and Elijah returned to class. Both of them were very sweaty and Elijah was carrying a basketball. "Sorry we took so long. We had to use the bathroom," said Elijah. "Yeah," chimed in Alvin, "it took longer than we thought.
"1. What prompted the teacher to be alert on the way back to class?
a. He noticed that all the students that he took to the washroom were with him.
b. He noticed that Rodney was unusually silent.
c. He noticed that not all the students were with him then.
d. He noticed that his best friend was missing in the group.
 2. The teacher noticed Rodney tapping his foot anxiously on the floor. What did the teacher deduce from this behavior?
a. The teacher thought that Rodney wanted to go the washroom again.
b. The teacher felt that Rodney was desperately trying to conceal something from him.
c. The teacher thought Rodney was tired of standing and his feet were aching.
d. The teacher thought Rodney was tapping to a song he was singing.
3. Where do you think Alvin and Elijah had been?
a. Alvin and Elijah had been to the washroom though they took some time.
b. Alvin and Elijah had been out in the sun since both of them came in sweaty.
c. Alvin and Elijah had been waiting for the announcement to be made.
d. Alvin and Elijah had sneaked out to play basketball for a while.</a>

                                            what is the purpose of the announcement?
Government should not raise fuel price to solve the problem of economic issues. People were affected severely with the high fuel price hike last year. Obviously they cut their spending. As an example, they had to buy lower quality of rice or palm oil. There were also fewer buyers of secondary commodities like flour, or canned meat or fish.Furthermore, the condition of low income family will become even worse because their expenses will increase while their salaries will not. Many companies will have to trim the number of employees because they are incapable of managing buying or selling price, standard wages and personal affairs.Finally, government should not raise fuel price to overcome economic problem but the solution should be sought by tapping into the nation’s own potential and utilizing it to enhance productivity to its maximum.</a>

Dear Endah,
Thank you for sending us the sample posters for our upcoming badminton match. In my opinion, the first poster is 1. ... than the second one, but the third is the funniest. I think the third poster is 2. ... of the three. It has the 3. ... slogan. But I think we 4. ... the celebrity photo. Even without it, the poster is still 5. ... than the other two. But that's just my opinion. Let's hear the comments of the other members at the next committee meeting at Hafiz's place.
To go to Hafiz' house, you 6. ... take the TransJakarta (TJ) bus. First, you should go to the nearest TJ bus shelter and 7. ... an e-money card there. You 8. ... fill the e-money card with an initial amount of Rp. 40,000. Then, tap the card at the gate to get into the waiting area. When you leave the shelter at your destination, you 9. ... your card at the gate again. But if you have a taxi provider application on your cell phone, you 10. ... go through the process of taking a TJ bus. OK, see you at Hafiz's house, Endah. Cheerio,
Ridwan.

                                            B. How to Weld Iron1. Gather your materials. You should have a welding machine, electrode holder with lead, ground clamp with lead, electrodes, and metal to be welded. 2. Put on your safety gear. This includes a welding helmet, welding jacket or cotton sweatshirt, pants without cuffs, work boots, gloves, and safety glasses. 3. Prepare the area to be welded in. Remove all flammable material and find a good surface to weld on. 4. Set up the machine. Most welding machines are fairly straight forward. You should most likely be using an amperage of around 90-120 amps, although this should be adjusted for metal thickness and electrode diameter.5. Use the correct electrode. You should select the electrode appropriate for AC or DC welding, depending on your machine. Make sure the electrodes are dry.6. Clean the metal before welding. This can be done by brushing the surface(s) to be welded with a wire brush or a grinder. Remove as much rust or paint from the metal as possible. 7. Set the joint. Use clamps and vises to ensure that the joint you are welding is precisely and firmly held together. 8. Strike a welding arc. This is accomplished by tapping the metal and quickly pulling up or striking it like a match. You are completing the circuit and pulling away, which causes the electricity to jump from the electrode to the metal. 9. Build up a weld pool When a stable arc can be maintained, ignore the end of the electro and instead watch the pool of molten metal. 10. Start moving the weld pool across the metal. Keep the electrode at an angle a few degr 11. Finish the weld. Pull the electrode back from the metal and allow it a few seconds to co. shy of 90 The metal will still be very hot at this point, but it should no longer be red hot.12. Clean the slacy. Slag is a retidue left from the welding process. During the weld protects the hot metal from contaminants. 13. Examine the weld. A welder's first welds are often poor and do not take stress well. Howe practice changes this Make another pass to fix any gaps or incomplete welds.14. Allow the metal to cool, Cooling in water will make the weld brittle, so allow any structural welds to cool by air instead. ​</a>

                                            Government should not raise fuel price to solve the problem of economic issues. People were affected severely with the high fuel price hike last year. Obviously they cut their spending. As an example, they had to buy lower quality of rice or palm oil. There were also fewer buyers of secondary commodities like flour, or canned meat or fish.Furthermore, the condition of low income family will become even worse because their expenses will increase while their salaries will not. Many companies will have to trim the number of employees because they are incapable of managing buying or selling price, standard wages and personal affairs.Finally, government should not raise fuel price to overcome economic problem but the solution should be sought by tapping into the nation’s own potential and utilizing it to enhance productivity to its maximum.</a>

                                            TEXT 9 The explanation shows that life condition is becoming more and more unconducive for good-quality life. Therefore, today more people than ever are looking for ways to improve their health, increase energy, reduce stress, restore or enhance functionality, relieve aches and pains, balance emotions, and sharpen mental focus. Because of the demands of modern life, most people want those ways to be relatively simple and not time-consuming. If you still have not found something to fit your needs, you may want to consider Chinese healing exercises. Chinese healing exercises make up a branch of Chinese medicine. It is almost never taught as a separate system of healing. Rather, it is used in many practices you probably recognize Some are part of the oldest of Chinese medical practices, including acupressure and tuina, a type of Chinese massage therapy. Others have their origins in ancient self-healing or spiritual practices, such as Chinese forms of yoga and meditation. They are routinely taught together with more detailed and complex practices, such as taiji (t'ai chi) qigong (chi gong), and other advanced medical, spiritual, or martial practices. They are intended to prepare a student for those more demanding disciplines. They are also conducted as adjunctive exercises that can make some aspects of the main practices easier to perform. Some sources are less well known in the west, like medical qigong and paidagong. They are tapping and patting techniques used to break up qi blockages. Qi is life force and is responsible for all healthy functionality, animation, vitality, emotional balance, and mental clarity. Chinese exercises have a uniquely positive impact on all those qualities, Chinese healing exercises can amplify the benefits from Taiji or qigong if you already have such a practice. In that context, they will open targeted areas of physical or energetic restriction, deepen your sensitivity to qi sensations, and increase qi flow. They root you more securely, thereby improving your overall performance. Adapted from:llewellyn.comwhat topic does the paragraph preceding the passage most likely discuss?​</a>

                            4. B. How to Weld Iron1. Gather your materials. You should have a welding machine, electrode holder with lead, groundclamp with lead, electrodes, and metal to be welded."2. Put on your safety gear. This includes a welding helmet, welding jacket or cotton sweatshirt,pants without cuffs, work boots, gloves, and safety glasses. 33. Prepare the area to be welded in. Remove all flammable material and find a good surfaceto weld on.t4. Set up the machine. Most welding machines are fairly straight forward. You should mostlikely be using an amperage of around 90-120 amps, although this should be adjusted formetal thickness and electrode diameter.5. Use the correct electrode. You should select the electrode appropriate for AC or DC welding,depending on your machine. Make sure the electrodes are dry.6. Clean the metal before welding. This can be done by brushing the surface(s) to be weldedwith a wire brush or a grinder. Remove as much rust or paint from the metal as possible.7. Set the joint. Use clamps and vises to ensure that the joint you are welding is precisely andfirmly held together.8. Strike a welding arc. This is accomplished by tapping the metal and quickly pulling up orstriking it like a match. You are completing the circuit and pulling away, which causes theelectricity to jump from the electrode to the metal.9. Build up a weld pool. When a stable arc can be maintained, ignore the end of the electrodeand instead watch the pool of molten metal.10. Start moving the weld pool across the metal. Keep the electrode at an angle a few degreesshy of 90°11. Finish the weld. Pull the electrode back from the metal and allow it a few seconds to cool.The metal will still be very hot at this point, but it should no longer be red hot.12. Clean the slag. Slag is a residue left from the welding process. During the weld, the slagprotects the hot metal from contaminants.13. Examine the weld. A welder's first welds are often poor and do not take stress well. However,practice changes this. Make another pass to fix any gaps or incomplete welds.14. Allow the metal to cool. Cooling in water will make the weld brittle, so allow any structuralwelds to cool by air instead.​ </h2><br />

                            9. what is the purpose of the announcement?
Government should not raise fuel price to solve the problem of economic issues. People were affected severely with the high fuel price hike last year. Obviously they cut their spending. As an example, they had to buy lower quality of rice or palm oil. There were also fewer buyers of secondary commodities like flour, or canned meat or fish.Furthermore, the condition of low income family will become even worse because their expenses will increase while their salaries will not. Many companies will have to trim the number of employees because they are incapable of managing buying or selling price, standard wages and personal affairs.Finally, government should not raise fuel price to overcome economic problem but the solution should be sought by tapping into the nation’s own potential and utilizing it to enhance productivity to its maximum.</h2><br />
                        <p>The purpose of the announcement is to tell the government that they should not increase the fuel price because it will affect lots of people life which make them even harder to buy primary commodities and harder to find a job.</p><p></p><p>Hope this help you </p><br />

Re: Posters and Hafiz's house
Dear Endah,
Thank you for sending us the sample posters for our upcoming badminton match. In my opinion, the first poster is 1. ... than the second one, but the third is the funniest. I think the third poster is 2. ... of the three. It has the 3. ... slogan. But I think we 4. ... the celebrity photo. Even without it, the poster is still 5. ... than the other two. But that's just my opinion. Let's hear the comments of the other members at the next committee meeting at Hafiz's place.
To go to Hafiz' house, you 6. ... take the TransJakarta (TJ) bus. First, you should go to the nearest TJ bus shelter and 7. ... an e-money card there. You 8. ... fill the e-money card with an initial amount of Rp. 40,000. Then, tap the card at the gate to get into the waiting area. When you leave the shelter at your destination, you 9. ... your card at the gate again. But if you have a taxi provider application on your cell phone, you 10. ... go through the process of taking a TJ bus. OK, see you at Hafiz's house, Endah. Cheerio,
Ridwan.

                            26. B. How to Weld Iron1. Gather your materials. You should have a welding machine, electrode holder with lead, ground clamp with lead, electrodes, and metal to be welded. 2. Put on your safety gear. This includes a welding helmet, welding jacket or cotton sweatshirt, pants without cuffs, work boots, gloves, and safety glasses. 3. Prepare the area to be welded in. Remove all flammable material and find a good surface to weld on. 4. Set up the machine. Most welding machines are fairly straight forward. You should most likely be using an amperage of around 90-120 amps, although this should be adjusted for metal thickness and electrode diameter.5. Use the correct electrode. You should select the electrode appropriate for AC or DC welding, depending on your machine. Make sure the electrodes are dry.6. Clean the metal before welding. This can be done by brushing the surface(s) to be welded with a wire brush or a grinder. Remove as much rust or paint from the metal as possible. 7. Set the joint. Use clamps and vises to ensure that the joint you are welding is precisely and firmly held together. 8. Strike a welding arc. This is accomplished by tapping the metal and quickly pulling up or striking it like a match. You are completing the circuit and pulling away, which causes the electricity to jump from the electrode to the metal. 9. Build up a weld pool When a stable arc can be maintained, ignore the end of the electro and instead watch the pool of molten metal. 10. Start moving the weld pool across the metal. Keep the electrode at an angle a few degr 11. Finish the weld. Pull the electrode back from the metal and allow it a few seconds to co. shy of 90 The metal will still be very hot at this point, but it should no longer be red hot.12. Clean the slacy. Slag is a retidue left from the welding process. During the weld protects the hot metal from contaminants. 13. Examine the weld. A welder's first welds are often poor and do not take stress well. Howe practice changes this Make another pass to fix any gaps or incomplete welds.14. Allow the metal to cool, Cooling in water will make the weld brittle, so allow any structural welds to cool by air instead. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>B. Cara Mengelas Besi</p><p> 1. Kumpulkan materi Anda.  Anda harus memiliki mesin las, tempat elektroda dengan timah, penjepit tanah dengan timah, elektroda, dan logam untuk dilas.</p><p></p><p> 2. Kenakan perlengkapan keselamatan Anda.  Ini termasuk helm las, jaket las atau kaus katun, celana tanpa manset, sepatu bot kerja, sarung tangan, dan kacamata pengaman.</p><p></p><p> 3. Siapkan area yang akan dilas. Singkirkan semua bahan yang mudah terbakar dan temukan permukaan yang bagus untuk dilas.</p><p></p><p> 4. Siapkan mesin.  Sebagian besar mesin las cukup lurus ke depan.  Anda kemungkinan besar harus menggunakan ampere sekitar 90-120 amp, meskipun ini harus disesuaikan dengan ketebalan logam dan diameter elektroda.</p><p></p><p> 5. Gunakan elektroda yang benar.  Anda harus memilih elektroda yang sesuai untuk pengelasan AC atau DC, tergantung pada mesin Anda.  Pastikan elektroda kering.</p><p></p><p> 6. Bersihkan logam sebelum pengelasan.  Ini dapat dilakukan dengan menyikat permukaan yang akan dilas dengan sikat kawat atau penggiling.  Singkirkan karat atau cat dari logam sebanyak mungkin.</p><p></p><p> 7. Atur sambungannya.  Gunakan penjepit dan pelindung untuk memastikan sambungan yang Anda las terpasang dengan tepat dan kuat.</p><p></p><p> 8. Buat busur las.  Ini dilakukan dengan mengetuk logam dan dengan cepat menarik atau memukulnya seperti korek api.  Anda menyelesaikan rangkaian dan menariknya, yang menyebabkan listrik melompat dari elektroda ke logam.</p><p></p><p> 9. Bangun kolam las Jika busur yang stabil dapat dipertahankan, abaikan ujung elektro dan perhatikan genangan logam cair.</p><p></p><p> 10. Mulai pindahkan kolam las melintasi logam.  Jaga elektroda pada sudut beberapa derajat</p><p></p><p> 11. Selesaikan pengelasan.  Tarik elektroda mundur dari logam dan biarkan beberapa detik hingga menempel.  malu 90 Logam masih akan sangat panas pada saat ini, tetapi seharusnya tidak lagi merah panas.</p><p></p><p> 12. Bersihkan slacy.  Terak merupakan rombongan sisa dari proses pengelasan.  Selama pengelasan melindungi logam panas dari kontaminan.</p><p></p><p> 13. Periksa lasan.  Pengelasan pertama tukang las sering kali buruk dan tidak menghilangkan stres dengan baik.  Bagaimana praktik mengubah ini Lakukan lintasan lain untuk memperbaiki celah atau pengelasan yang tidak lengkap.</p><p></p><p> 14. Biarkan logam menjadi dingin, Pendinginan dalam air akan membuat las rapuh, jadi biarkan semua las struktural mendingin melalui udara.</p><br />

</p><p>Artinya:</p><p>Pemerintah seharusnya tidak menaikkan harga bahan bakar untuk menyelesaikan masalah-masalah ekonomi. Masyarakat sangat merasakan dampaknya atas kenaikan harga bahan bakar yang tinggi tahun lalu. Jelaslah mereka menggurangi pengeluaran mereka. Sebagai contoh, mereka harus membeli beras atau minyak goreng dengan kualitas lebih rendah. Terjadinya penurunan konsumen terhadap komoditas sekunder seperti tepung, atau daging kalengan atau ikan. Selain itu, kondisi keluarga berpenghasilan rendah akan menjadi lebih buruk karena pengeluaran mereka akan meningkat sedangkan gaji mereka tidak mengalami peningkatan. Banyak perusahaan harus memangkas jumlah karyawan karena mereka tidak mampu mengelola harga beli atau jual, upah standar dan urusan pribadi. Kesimpulannya, pemerintah tidak seharusnya menaikkan harga bahan bakar untuk mengatasi masalah ekonomi tetapi solusinya harus dicari dengan memanfaatkan potensi negara sendiri dan menggunakannya untuk meningkatkan produktivitas secara maksimal.</p><p>--------------------------------------</p>Hortatory Exposition Text1.

Orang-orang sangat terpengaruh dengan kenaikan harga bahan bakar yang tinggi tahun lalu.  Jelas mereka memotong pengeluaran mereka.

Ada juga lebih sedikit pembeli komoditas sekunder seperti tepung, atau daging kaleng atau ikan. Selain itu, kondisi keluarga berpenghasilan rendah akan menjadi lebih buruk karena pengeluaran mereka akan meningkat sedangkan gaji mereka tidak.  Banyak perusahaan harus memangkas jumlah karyawan karena mereka tidak mampu mengelola harga beli atau jual, upah standar, dan urusan pribadi.

                            39. TEXT 9 The explanation shows that life condition is becoming more and more unconducive for good-quality life. Therefore, today more people than ever are looking for ways to improve their health, increase energy, reduce stress, restore or enhance functionality, relieve aches and pains, balance emotions, and sharpen mental focus. Because of the demands of modern life, most people want those ways to be relatively simple and not time-consuming. If you still have not found something to fit your needs, you may want to consider Chinese healing exercises. Chinese healing exercises make up a branch of Chinese medicine. It is almost never taught as a separate system of healing. Rather, it is used in many practices you probably recognize Some are part of the oldest of Chinese medical practices, including acupressure and tuina, a type of Chinese massage therapy. Others have their origins in ancient self-healing or spiritual practices, such as Chinese forms of yoga and meditation. They are routinely taught together with more detailed and complex practices, such as taiji (t'ai chi) qigong (chi gong), and other advanced medical, spiritual, or martial practices. They are intended to prepare a student for those more demanding disciplines. They are also conducted as adjunctive exercises that can make some aspects of the main practices easier to perform. Some sources are less well known in the west, like medical qigong and paidagong. They are tapping and patting techniques used to break up qi blockages. Qi is life force and is responsible for all healthy functionality, animation, vitality, emotional balance, and mental clarity. Chinese exercises have a uniquely positive impact on all those qualities, Chinese healing exercises can amplify the benefits from Taiji or qigong if you already have such a practice. In that context, they will open targeted areas of physical or energetic restriction, deepen your sensitivity to qi sensations, and increase qi flow. They root you more securely, thereby improving your overall performance. Adapted from:llewellyn.comwhat topic does the paragraph preceding the passage most likely discuss?​</h2><br />
