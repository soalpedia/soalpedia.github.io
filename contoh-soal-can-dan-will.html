                                            Read the text to answer questions 1 to 3.The sugar glider is a marsupial, just like the many other Australian animals – the kangaroo, the koala and the wombat for instance. The sugar glider is a possum – very similar to the tupai in Indonesia. It basically lives in trees. It eats leaves and fruit. However, the Australian sugar glider has a very special skill. It can jump from tree to tree like a tupai but it can also `sort of fly’ as well. In fact, it glides or terbang layang in Bahasa Indonesia. When it jumps from one tree to another it spreads its four legs out wide; and its extra skin also spreads out and functions like a parachute.1. What does the text tell us about?…A.  The kangaroo B.

                                            What to do After High School Graduation
Going to college or getting a job right after graduating high school is the common choices of teens will likely face. Some likely choose to continue studying at college or university but the others try to find job. Here are the reasons.
Why is it so important for student to continue on to post-secondary education; university or college? The reason is that post-secondary education will allow them to get the skills and tools that they will need to help them prepare for a good career. It has been said that the more education they have the more careers will be open for them to choose from. Employers today will tend to be more open to a person with the more education.
However some of them choose to get job right after high school. They believe that education is critical but college is not. In fact, there are numerous careers, such as in healthcare, technology, operations, transportation, and the building trades, that do not require a four-year degree from college or university. Furthermore, as they advance in these careers, there is also nothing stopping them from pursing a college degree at a later age.So, what are you doing after graduating high school? Think carefully! The wrong decision may influence your future. But who knows the future? Believe to God and do the best!
Questions: 1. What is the text talking about? 2. What is the choices that can be chosen after graduating? Mention! 3. What makes important in continuing study in the college? 4. What is the statement said by the cons side? 5. What does the employer today look like?​

Those in the retail industry that are successful in digitally transforming will be ones that leverage technology to innovate around an immersive and disruptive customer experience. These "lighthouse" retailers are the ones driving innovation, adopting emerging technologies early, and showing the industry what works and is possible. They are the ones experimenting with new models and store formats, playing with recombinations/reconfigurations of scale, assets, product, place, and people. The "store of the future" is the keystone of this effort.
The store of the future will combine multiple formats to deliver an immersive and unique experience across all customer touchpoints online and in the store. It will be heavily instrumented for operational efficiency and digitally connected end-to-end to leverage a single view of customer, product, and order. The store of the future – despite its reliance on sophisticated technology and infrastructure – will be trying to look smaller and less intimidating, more personalized, and frictionless.
The deployment of these and other digital technologies in disruptive ways can turn visitors into shoppers and shoppers into brand-loyal customers. However, understanding which consumers want personalization and which want contextualized and relevant experiences, while protecting everyone’s privacy, has grown more difficult. With so much at stake, data privacy has become a challenge for every party involved.

for all men and women in all parts of the world and for all times. It is

Sleepiness after eating is a response of the body to chemical changes during the digestion process. This is normal and it happens to everybody. However, if sleepiness occurs every time after eating and obstructs your ability to function, this may be a concern. Sleepiness after eating is caused by many factors, such as the type of food you consume, messy sleeping habits, your health condition and so forth. The body requires energy to function and this energy is obtained through food. Post-eating, the body releases hormones such as amylin, glucagon and cholecystokinin. These hormones increase blood sugar levels, creating a feeling of fullness and producing insulin that will be streamed through cell tissues and provide energy for them. At the same time, the brain releases serotonin that causes drowsiness.
Moreover, food also influences melatonin production in the brain. This is the hormone that is responsible for sleepiness post-meal. Some foods that are rich in protein, such as meat, poultry, eggs, fish, spinach, tofu, cheese and soybeans can trigger more drowsiness than others. Additionally, foods containing carbohydrates also help produce serotonin and tryptophan amino acids found in the brain. This is the reason why you feel sleepy after eating carbohydrate-rich foods.
Overeating can also cause sleepiness. Post-meal, the body streams more blood to the digestive system to better digest foods in massive amounts. This causes a temporary blood and nutrients shortage in the brain. To prevent post-meal drowsiness, it’s better to eat a balanced diet containing vegetables, grains and good fats to provide continuous energy. Drink lots of water and limit your sugar intake.
Bad sleeping patterns can also cause sleepiness after eating. After a meal, the body feels full and relaxed, making the body feel like it is resting, resulting in a feeling of sleepiness, particularly if you didn’t get a good night’s sleep the night before. To avoid this, improve your sleeping habits to prevent stress. Engaging in regular physical exercise can help you get a good night’s sleep. It is recommended that you avoid napping if you are having trouble sleeping at night.

Loneliness and social isolation in older adults are serious public health risks affecting a significant number of people in the United States and putting them at risk for dementia and other serious medical conditions. A report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) points out that more than one-third of adults aged 45 and older feel lonely, and nearly one-fourth of adults aged 65 and older are considered to be socially isolated. Older adults are at increased risk for loneliness and social isolation because they are more likely to face factors such as living alone, the loss of family or friends, chronic illness, and hearing loss.
Although it’s hard to measure social isolation and loneliness precisely, there is strong evidence that many adults aged 50 and older are socially isolated or lonely in ways that put their health at risk. Recent studies found that social isolation significantly increased a person’s risk of premature death from all causes, a risk that may rival those of smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity. Poor social relationships (characterized by social isolation or loneliness) was also associated with a 29% increased risk of heart disease. Loneliness among heart failure patients was associated with a nearly 4 times increased risk of death, 68% increased risk of hospitalization, and 57% increased risk of emergency department visits.
1. The writer's intention in writing the passage is to ....
a.	disseminate the information about the impacts loneliness and social isolation in the elderly
b.	encourage people to be more concerned about the elderly who are lonely and socially isolated
c.	prove that the elderly experiencing loneliness and social isolation actually exist in the United States
d.	convey the pain and sadness experienced by lonely and socially isolated elderly based on research
e.	tell about the loneliness and unhappiness felt by the elderly who are socially isolated, as well as research findings
2. To whom is the text likely addressed?
a.	Families staying with elderly
b.	People living around elderly
c.	Pensioners who have just left their jobs
d.	Senior citizens living alone in the suburbs
e.	Employers having old workers in their companies
3. From the last paragraph, we can infer that …
a.	Those who experience loneliness may develop heart disease.
b.	Feeling lonely aggravates the heart condition of the elderly.
c.	Heart disease is the worst ailment that a lonely older person will suffer from.
d.	The older people get, the more lonely they will feel.
e.	Loneliness and social isolation that people experience makes them unable to survive.</a>

                                            What to do After High School Graduation
Going to college or getting a job right after graduating high school is the common choices of teens will likely face. Some likely choose to continue studying at college or university but the others try to find job. Here are the reasons.
Why is it so important for student to continue on to post-secondary education; university or college? The reason is that post-secondary education will allow them to get the skills and tools that they will need to help them prepare for a good career. It has been said that the more education they have the more careers will be open for them to choose from. Employers today will tend to be more open to a person with the more education.
However some of them choose to get job right after high school. They believe that education is critical but college is not. In fact, there are numerous careers, such as in healthcare, technology, operations, transportation, and the building trades, that do not require a four-year degree from college or university. Furthermore, as they advance in these careers, there is also nothing stopping them from pursing a college degree at a later age.So, what are you doing after graduating high school? Think carefully! The wrong decision may influence your future. But who knows the future? Believe to God and do the best!
Questions: 1. What is the text talking about? 2. What is the choices that can be chosen after graduating? Mention! 3. What makes important in continuing study in the college? 4. What is the statement said by the cons side? 5. What does the employer today look like?​

                            8. Read the text to answer questions 1 to 3.The sugar glider is a marsupial, just like the many other Australian animals – the kangaroo, the koala and the wombat for instance. The sugar glider is a possum – very similar to the tupai in Indonesia. It basically lives in trees. It eats leaves and fruit. However, the Australian sugar glider has a very special skill. It can jump from tree to tree like a tupai but it can also `sort of fly’ as well. In fact, it glides or terbang layang in Bahasa Indonesia. When it jumps from one tree to another it spreads its four legs out wide; and its extra skin also spreads out and functions like a parachute.1. What does the text tell us about?…A.  The kangaroo B.  The koalaC.  The wombatD.  The sugar glider2. Why can the sugar glider glide from tree to tree?A.  It can spread its four legs and skin out wideB.  It is very similar to the squirrels in IndonesiaC.

It eats leaves and fruit3.“….. it spreads its four legs out wide ……” The word made bold means…A.  executesB.  exceedsC.  extendsD.  examinesRead the text to answer questions 4 to 6.The largest meat-eating animal in the world is the brown bear that lives in Alaska. “Brownie”, as this bear is called, will always keep away from people. But, be careful if it is wounded with a gun or the mother bear and her cubs are shocked. Some hunters claim the brown bear can outfight a tiger. A grown brownie may be up to nine feet tall. It may weigh over 1,600 pounds. But home when the brown bear is born, it weighs less than one pound. If you grew at the same rate, you would weigh almost 10,000 pounds when you were fully grown!4.

Why is it so important for student to continue on to post-secondary education; university or college? The reason is that post-secondary education will allow them to get the skills and tools that they will need to help them prepare for a good career.

In fact, there are numerous careers, such as in healthcare, technology, operations, transportation, and the building trades, that do not require a four-year degree from college or university. Furthermore, as they advance in these careers, there is also nothing stopping them from pursing a college degree at a later age.So, what are you doing after graduating high school? Think carefully! The wrong decision may influence your future. But who knows the future? Believe to God and do the best!

Those in the retail industry that are successful in digitally transforming will be ones that leverage technology to innovate around an immersive and disruptive customer experience. These "lighthouse" retailers are the ones driving innovation, adopting emerging technologies early, and showing the industry what works and is possible. They are the ones experimenting with new models and store formats, playing with recombinations/reconfigurations of scale, assets, product, place, and people. The "store of the future" is the keystone of this effort.
The store of the future will combine multiple formats to deliver an immersive and unique experience across all customer touchpoints online and in the store. It will be heavily instrumented for operational efficiency and digitally connected end-to-end to leverage a single view of customer, product, and order. The store of the future – despite its reliance on sophisticated technology and infrastructure – will be trying to look smaller and less intimidating, more personalized, and frictionless.
The deployment of these and other digital technologies in disruptive ways can turn visitors into shoppers and shoppers into brand-loyal customers. However, understanding which consumers want personalization and which want contextualized and relevant experiences, while protecting everyone’s privacy, has grown more difficult. With so much at stake, data privacy has become a challenge for every party involved.

THE QURAN
The Quran is the book of Allah. Every word of the Quran is the 
word of Allah. It is a book of Guidance. It is preserved in its original 
form. Not a single word of it has been changed or lost. It is found 
today exactly as it was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (p.b.u.h). 
How was the Quran revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (p.b.u.h)? 
Allah revealed the Quran through the Angel Gabriel. Gabriel passed 
on Allah’s words to Muhammad (p.b.u.h), then Muhammad (p.b.u.h) 
asked his secretary to write down exactly what Gabriel told him.
The revelation was completed over a period of 23 years. Some 
muslims learn the whole of the Quran by heart, but all Muslims learn 
parts of the Quran by heart. It is preserved through memory as well as 
writing. It was written down from the very beginning. Allah has given 
His protection to it and it will always be preserved. Nobody can 
change it, as was said by Allah, “Allah sent it and will protect it”
The Quran is the Final book sent by Allah, it is a great and noble 
book. It was revealed in the Arabic language in a beautiful style. Its

Sleepiness after eating is a response of the body to chemical changes during the digestion process. This is normal and it happens to everybody. However, if sleepiness occurs every time after eating and obstructs your ability to function, this may be a concern. Sleepiness after eating is caused by many factors, such as the type of food you consume, messy sleeping habits, your health condition and so forth. The body requires energy to function and this energy is obtained through food. Post-eating, the body releases hormones such as amylin, glucagon and cholecystokinin. These hormones increase blood sugar levels, creating a feeling of fullness and producing insulin that will be streamed through cell tissues and provide energy for them. At the same time, the brain releases serotonin that causes drowsiness.
Moreover, food also influences melatonin production in the brain. This is the hormone that is responsible for sleepiness post-meal. Some foods that are rich in protein, such as meat, poultry, eggs, fish, spinach, tofu, cheese and soybeans can trigger more drowsiness than others. Additionally, foods containing carbohydrates also help produce serotonin and tryptophan amino acids found in the brain. This is the reason why you feel sleepy after eating carbohydrate-rich foods.
Overeating can also cause sleepiness. Post-meal, the body streams more blood to the digestive system to better digest foods in massive amounts. This causes a temporary blood and nutrients shortage in the brain. To prevent post-meal drowsiness, it’s better to eat a balanced diet containing vegetables, grains and good fats to provide continuous energy. Drink lots of water and limit your sugar intake.
Bad sleeping patterns can also cause sleepiness after eating. After a meal, the body feels full and relaxed, making the body feel like it is resting, resulting in a feeling of sleepiness, particularly if you didn’t get a good night’s sleep the night before. To avoid this, improve your sleeping habits to prevent stress. Engaging in regular physical exercise can help you get a good night’s sleep. It is recommended that you avoid napping if you are having trouble sleeping at night.

Loneliness and social isolation in older adults are serious public health risks affecting a significant number of people in the United States and putting them at risk for dementia and other serious medical conditions. A report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) points out that more than one-third of adults aged 45 and older feel lonely, and nearly one-fourth of adults aged 65 and older are considered to be socially isolated. Older adults are at increased risk for loneliness and social isolation because they are more likely to face factors such as living alone, the loss of family or friends, chronic illness, and hearing loss.
Although it’s hard to measure social isolation and loneliness precisely, there is strong evidence that many adults aged 50 and older are socially isolated or lonely in ways that put their health at risk. Recent studies found that social isolation significantly increased a person’s risk of premature death from all causes, a risk that may rival those of smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity. Poor social relationships (characterized by social isolation or loneliness) was also associated with a 29% increased risk of heart disease. Loneliness among heart failure patients was associated with a nearly 4 times increased risk of death, 68% increased risk of hospitalization, and 57% increased risk of emergency department visits.

a.	disseminate the information about the impacts loneliness and social isolation in the elderly

d.	convey the pain and sadness experienced by lonely and socially isolated elderly based on research
e.	tell about the loneliness and unhappiness felt by the elderly who are socially isolated, as well as research findings

a.	Families staying with elderly
b.	People living around elderly
c.	Pensioners who have just left their jobs
d.	Senior citizens living alone in the suburbs
e.	Employers having old workers in their companies
3. From the last paragraph, we can infer that …

b.	Feeling lonely aggravates the heart condition of the elderly.
c.	Heart disease is the worst ailment that a lonely older person will suffer from.
d.	The older people get, the more lonely they will feel.

                            32. What to do After High School Graduation
Going to college or getting a job right after graduating high school is the common choices of teens will likely face. Some likely choose to continue studying at college or university but the others try to find job. Here are the reasons.
Why is it so important for student to continue on to post-secondary education; university or college? The reason is that post-secondary education will allow them to get the skills and tools that they will need to help them prepare for a good career. It has been said that the more education they have the more careers will be open for them to choose from. Employers today will tend to be more open to a person with the more education.
However some of them choose to get job right after high school. They believe that education is critical but college is not. In fact, there are numerous careers, such as in healthcare, technology, operations, transportation, and the building trades, that do not require a four-year degree from college or university. Furthermore, as they advance in these careers, there is also nothing stopping them from pursing a college degree at a later age.So, what are you doing after graduating high school? Think carefully! The wrong decision may influence your future. But who knows the future? Believe to God and do the best!
Questions: 1. What is the text talking about? 2. What is the choices that can be chosen after graduating? Mention! 3. What makes important in continuing study in the college? 4. What is the statement said by the cons side? 5. What does the employer today look like?​

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Apa yang Harus Dilakukan Setelah Lulus SMA?
</p><p>Pergi ke perguruan tinggi atau mendapatkan pekerjaan setelah lulus sekolah menengah adalah pilihan umum yang kemungkinan akan dihadapi remaja. Beberapa mungkin memilih untuk melanjutkan belajar di perguruan tinggi atau universitas tetapi yang lain mencoba mencari pekerjaan. Inilah alasannya.
</p><p>
</p><p>Mengapa sangat penting bagi siswa untuk melanjutkan ke pendidikan pasca sekolah menengah; universitas atau perguruan tinggi? Alasannya adalah bahwa pendidikan pasca sekolah menengah akan memungkinkan mereka untuk mendapatkan keterampilan dan alat yang mereka perlukan untuk membantu mereka mempersiapkan karir yang baik. Dikatakan bahwa semakin tinggi pendidikan yang mereka miliki, semakin banyak karir yang terbuka bagi mereka untuk dipilih. Pengusaha saat ini akan cenderung lebih terbuka kepada orang yang berpendidikan lebih tinggi.
</p><p>
</p><p>Namun beberapa dari mereka memilih untuk mendapatkan pekerjaan setelah sekolah menengah. Mereka percaya bahwa pendidikan sangat penting tetapi perguruan tinggi tidak. Sebenarnya, ada banyak karir, seperti dalam perawatan kesehatan, teknologi, operasi, transportasi, dan perdagangan bangunan, yang tidak memerlukan gelar empat tahun dari perguruan tinggi atau universitas. Selain itu, seiring dengan kemajuan karir mereka, tidak ada yang menghentikan mereka untuk mengejar gelar sarjana di usia yang lebih tua. Jadi, apa yang Anda lakukan setelah lulus SMA? Pikirkan baik-baik! Keputusan yang salah dapat mempengaruhi masa depan Anda. Tapi siapa yang tahu masa depan? Percaya kepada Tuhan dan lakukan yang terbaik!</p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p><strong>hanya bisa jawab bagian itu jangan kecewa ya:&lt;</strong></p><br />
