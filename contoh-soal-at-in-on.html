The question is based on the following passage.
(The story by Sanjib Chaudhary originally appeared on Global Voices on August 8, 2020)
After news of the existence of a yellow turtle in India's eastern state of Odisha went viral this past July, Nepalis wanted to remind the world that they made a similar discovery first — on April 14, 2018, to be exact — when a rare, golden turtle — but a different species — was found for the first time in southeastern Nepal’s Dhanushadham municipality. According to a research paper by Kamal Devkota, Dev Narayan Mandal and Hinrich Kaiser, which was published in the journal Herpetology Notes, the turtle was released into its natural habitat after pictures were taken as proof.
A normal Indian flapshell turtle is greenish-grey in colour, with yellow marks on its head and neck. It has a grey carapace dotted with dark yellow spots and derives its name from the femoral flaps at the plastron, the ventral part of the shell. These turtles are found in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, most typically in ditches, lakes, ponds, and paddy fields with stagnant water. Omnivorous in nature, they eat anything from leaves and flowers to snails, fish, and frogs. While a normal-coloured flapshell turtle can easily camouflage itself in the murky, greenish water, its golden-coloured variant — a turtle with chromatic leucism — is easily recognisable and therefore more vulnerable. Its luminous golden colour, in particular, makes it a prized pet.
The congenital disorder of albinism creates a complete absence of pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes due to the lack of tyrosinase, an enzyme involved in the production of melanin. Researchers estimate that albinism occurs once in every 10,000 mammal births. Leucism, on the other hand, is an extremely rare genetic condition in which animals have reduced pigmentation. Most leucistic animals have normal-coloured eyes, whereas those with albinism tend to have red or pink eyes.
Nepal is home to 16 species of turtles, of which four are critically endangered: the three-striped roofed turtle (Kachuga dhongoka), the red-crowned roofed turtle (Kachuga kachuga), the Indian narrow-headed softshell turtle (Chitra indica), and the elongated tortoise (Indotestudo elongata). Though turtles play an important role in reducing pollution by feeding on insects, vegetation, and dead animals, factors like habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation have been threatening their survival. According to "Turtles of Nepal – A Field Guide for Species Accounts and Distribution," the draining of wetlands for irrigation and fishing, the excessive use of agrochemicals which eventually seep into waterways, and unsustainable fishing methods all negatively impact turtle populations.

a. physical appearance of turtles

b. Both Nepalis and Indians found new rare turtles at different times.
c. A turtle with chromatic leucism is insusceptible topredators.
d. Animals with albinism and leucism can bedistinguished.
e. Turtles can help humans to keep the environment healthy.
3. The paragraph following the passage will most likely discuss .…
a. research on all turtle populations
b. dangerous factors for turtle populations
c. the suggestion to look after our environment
d. turtle populations’ contribution to reduce pollution
e. some ways to save turtles from threatening factors</a>

The Eiffel Tower is located on the Champ de Mars in Paris. Built in 1889, it has become both a global icon of France and one of the most recognizable building in the world.
It is the highest building in Paris and the most-visited monument in the world. Millions of people visit it every year. The engineer Gustave Eifell came up with his name for this tower. It was built as the entrance arch to the 1889 World’s Fair.
The tower is 324 meters (1,063 ft) tall, and has height as an 80-storey building. Upon its completion, it is higher than the Washington Monument to assume the title of the tallest man-made structure in the world. The title is held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York city was built in 1930. But due to the addition of antenna in 1957, the tower is now higher than the Chrysler Building and it is the second-tallest structure in France after the 2004.

The question is based on the following text.
(The story by Oiwan Lam originally appeared on Global Voices, on December 2, 2020)
Over a dozen journalists resigned on December 1 from Hong Kong Cable Television Limited, a major subscription-based TV station in Hong Kong, in protest after the media company fired 40 editorial staff in what is perceived as a political crackdown. Those laid off include the head of the China desk and the entire team of the award-winning News Lancet program. The broadcaster cited financial reasons for the layoff, a claim the newsroom staff rebukes. The entire China desk, a total of 12 people, has since resigned in protest, along with the heads of the international and finance desks and the newsroom's chief assignment editor.
The layoffs were sudden and took immediate effect — those who were sacked were told to leave the office on the same day. In shock, members of staff gathered outside the room of the news director demanding an explanation. Among those laid off is Wong Lai-ping, former deputy news editor at the China desk. On a radio interview aired on December 2, she rebuked the management's claim that the decision was made out of financial difficulties, remarking that in August, the management fired the then-executive director Fung Tak-hung and replaced him with four new managers. Wong said that the new management often made editorial requests, such as live broadcasts of China's foreign minister's regular press conference, or modifying headlines. According to Wong, the newsroom staff refused to comply with such requests.
The Hong Kong Journalists Association commented on the layoffs, "Given the [New Lancet] team’s coverage of the police and administration, it’s difficult not to see this as minimizing sensitive reporting in the name of cost-cutting".
1. Based on the text, the trigger of this resignation en masse is the belief that ….
a. the previous layoffs were politically motivated
b. financial reasons affected the layoffs the most
c. the journalists could demand for higher salary
d. political crackdown barely prompted the layoffs
e. the management's disapproved of staffs' refusal of demands
2. Dealing with the issue discussed in the text, the statement above may lead the readers to the assumption that …
a. The management’s claim should have been accepted by all parties.
b. The decision to fire Fung Tak-hung was taken with well-consideration.
c. The director Fung Tak-hung was not as competent as four new managers.
d. There was an illogical situation to claim financial difficulties as the reason for the layoffs.
e. The management tried to cover up their financial difficulties by cutting the number of employees.</a>

Read the following text!
The latest round in an ongoing debate over global-warming trends claims that warming has indeed slowed down this century. An obvious slowing in the rise of global temperatures was recorded at the beginning of the twenty-first century. This was referred to as a "hiatus" or a "pause". This hiatus was first observed several years ago. Climate-change skeptics have used this as evidence that global warming has stopped permanently. But in June the previous year, a study in science claimed that the hiatus was just an artifact which disappears when biases in temperature data are corrected.
Now a prominent group of researchers is countering that claim. They argue in Nature Climate Change that even after correcting these biases the slowdown was real. "There is this mismatch between what the climate models are producing and what the observations are showing," says lead author John Fyfe. "We can't ignore it." Fyfe uses the term "slowdown" rather than "hiatus". He also stresses that it does not in any way weaken global-warming theory.
The study that questioned the existence of the slowdown corrected known biases in the surface temperature record maintained by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The finding showed differences in temperature readings from ships and buoys. This effectively increased the record about warming. The researchers also extended the record to include 2014. This set a new record high for average temperatures.
Thomas Karl, director of National Centers for Environmental Information in Asheville, calculated the rate of global warming between 1950 and 1999 as being 0.113°C per decade. This was similar to the 0.116°C a decade calculated for 2000-14. This, Karl said, meant that an assessment done by the influential Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2013 showing that warming had slowed was no longer valid.
1. The passage above mainly discusses about….
a. the hiatus observation was first carried out several years ago
b. the reason why global warming is slowing down in this century
c. global warming is a verifiable issue in the space of a decade
d. the contention about global warming and whether it is indeed slowing this period
e. the view of study in science that the hiatus is an artifact which vanishes
The word "prominent" in paragraph 2 means….
a. well-known
b. promenade
c. shrewd
d. indolent
e. magnificent
3. Why have some claimed that global warming a fabricated issue?
1. Because there’s no valid data to prove that global warming is real.
2. Since the existence of the slowdown corrected known biases in the surface temperature record upheld by the US NOAA.
3. As an assessment done on Climate Change presenting that warming had slowed was no longer valid.
4. For the researchers is countering that in Nature Climate Change even after correcting these biases the slowdown was real.
5. Because of the diversification in temperature readings from ships and buoys, the study found.</a>

When we got to the zoo, we went to the shop to buy some food to give to the animals. After getting the food, we went to the nocturnal house where we saw birds and reptiles which only come out at night. Before having lunch, we went for a ride on the elephant. It was a thrill to ride it. Dad fell off when he let go off the rope, but he was ok. During the lunch we fed some birds in the park. In the afternoon we saw the animals being fed. When we returned home we were very tired but happy. It was because we had so much fun activities at many places at the zoo.</a>

A kangaroo is an animal found only in Australia. It has a smaller relative, called a wallaby, which lives on the Australian Island of Tasmania and in New Guinea.
Kangaroos eat grass and plants. They have short front legs, but very long and strong back legs and a tail. These are used for sitting up and for jumping. Kangaroos have been known to make forward jumps of over eight meters, and leap across fences more than three meters high. They can also run at speeds of over 45 kilometers per hour.
The largest kangaroos are the Great grey kangaroo and the Red Kangaroo. Adult grows to a length of 1.60 meters and weighs over 90 kilos.
Kangaroos are marsupials. This means that the female kangaroo has an external pouch on the front of her body. A baby kangaroo is very tiny when it is born, and it crawls at once into this pouch where it spends its first five months of life.

Read the following text!
Over the last two decades, the use of ICT has been an important topic in education. On the one hand, studies have shown that ICT can enhance teaching and learning outcomes. For example, in science and mathematics education, scholars have documented that the use of ICT can improve students’ conceptual understanding, problem solving, and team working skills. Consequently, most curriculum documents state the importance of ICT and encourage school teachers to use them. However, teachers need to specifically trained in order to integrate ICT in their teaching.
Schools are known to be resistant to innovation and change, however, the spread of ICT is beginning to affect how teachers teach. One of the current issues about the use of ICT is how it is integrated into the curriculum. The curriculum document provide arguments for introducing ICT in the school setting. Therefore, schools expect that graduates from teacher education programs have a reasonable knowledge of how to use ICT. However, this may not be the case because most current teachers’ pre-service preparation, and subsequent in-service courses were designed by using traditional educational technology and settings. Thus, the participants in these courses are not familiar with the processes, interaction patterns, features, and possibilities of teaching learning processes based on ICT.
Effective development of pre-service teachers’ ICT proficiency does not seem to be a direct process, but is the one asking for a careful, complex approach. First, a need assessment is important to find out what ICT skills and knowledge teachers need at schools. Second, designers of teacher education programs should know the pre-service teachers’ perceptions of ICT and their attitudes toward ICT integration into curriculum. Third, teacher education programs need to consider the two typical arguments that support the ICT use in schools.

b.         Studies have shown that ICT can enrich teaching and learning end result
c.        The use of ICT has been an insignificant topic in education. Also, studies have shown that ICT can enhance teaching and learning outcomes.
d.        Over the last two decades, the use of ICT has been an important topic in educational method.
e.        Over the preceding two decades, studies have exposed that ICT can increase teaching and learning outcomes.
2.  Based on the passage, paragraph 1 most likely discusses….
a.         educational growth in the last two decades

                            14. In 1903, Mary Anderson and a friend were driving to New York. It was raining heavily and they had to open the windows of their car and put their heads out to see better. Suddenly Mary had an idea. In 1869, Thomas Adams was trying to produce rubber out of the juice he got from Mexican sapodilla trees. He wanted to produce toys, rain boots and bicycle tyres. The experiment didn’t work. While he was thinking about this, he took a piece of the rubber he was working with and put it in his mouth. In 1897, British inventor James Henry Atkinson was looking at the family’s supply of potatoes, which they kept in a room under their house. He noticed that mice had eaten some of the potatoes so he invented something that he called ‘Little Nipper’ to stop them.In 1886, Josephine Cochran was standing in her kitchen in Illinois, USA. The family lunch was fi nished. There was a mountain of dishes in front of Mrs Cochran and she got quite angry, thinking that she had to do this job every day. ‘If nobody else is going to invent a machine for this, I’ll do it myself,’ she thought. In the early years of the eighteenth century, in the middle of the summer, an unknown Dutchman was looking at one of the many canals in Holland. He was thinking that he often travelled along the frozen canals on ice skates in the winter. He got a little impatient. ‘I don’t want to wait for winter!’ he thought.soal buat 1 contoh kalimat dari teks tsb yg merupakan past tense dan past continuous kemudian berikan rangkuman minimal 5 kalimat?(soal buku cambridge second edition hal 12)​</h2><br />

                            16. Contoh Soal UTBK SNPMB
The question is based on the following passage.
(The story by Sanjib Chaudhary originally appeared on Global Voices on August 8, 2020)
After news of the existence of a yellow turtle in India's eastern state of Odisha went viral this past July, Nepalis wanted to remind the world that they made a similar discovery first — on April 14, 2018, to be exact — when a rare, golden turtle — but a different species — was found for the first time in southeastern Nepal’s Dhanushadham municipality. According to a research paper by Kamal Devkota, Dev Narayan Mandal and Hinrich Kaiser, which was published in the journal Herpetology Notes, the turtle was released into its natural habitat after pictures were taken as proof.
A normal Indian flapshell turtle is greenish-grey in colour, with yellow marks on its head and neck. It has a grey carapace dotted with dark yellow spots and derives its name from the femoral flaps at the plastron, the ventral part of the shell. These turtles are found in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, most typically in ditches, lakes, ponds, and paddy fields with stagnant water. Omnivorous in nature, they eat anything from leaves and flowers to snails, fish, and frogs. While a normal-coloured flapshell turtle can easily camouflage itself in the murky, greenish water, its golden-coloured variant — a turtle with chromatic leucism — is easily recognisable and therefore more vulnerable. Its luminous golden colour, in particular, makes it a prized pet.
The congenital disorder of albinism creates a complete absence of pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes due to the lack of tyrosinase, an enzyme involved in the production of melanin. Researchers estimate that albinism occurs once in every 10,000 mammal births. Leucism, on the other hand, is an extremely rare genetic condition in which animals have reduced pigmentation. Most leucistic animals have normal-coloured eyes, whereas those with albinism tend to have red or pink eyes.
Nepal is home to 16 species of turtles, of which four are critically endangered: the three-striped roofed turtle (Kachuga dhongoka), the red-crowned roofed turtle (Kachuga kachuga), the Indian narrow-headed softshell turtle (Chitra indica), and the elongated tortoise (Indotestudo elongata). Though turtles play an important role in reducing pollution by feeding on insects, vegetation, and dead animals, factors like habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation have been threatening their survival. According to "Turtles of Nepal – A Field Guide for Species Accounts and Distribution," the draining of wetlands for irrigation and fishing, the excessive use of agrochemicals which eventually seep into waterways, and unsustainable fishing methods all negatively impact turtle populations.
1. The third paragraph of the passage above mainly discusses ….
a. physical appearance of turtles
b. congenital disorders in sea-mammals
c. the difference between two congenital illnesses
d. albinism, leucism, and how to treat them
e. albinism and leucism as hazardous congenital disorders
2. Which of the following is NOT TRUE according to the passage above?
a. A quarter of all turtle species in Nepal are threatened with extinction.
b. Both Nepalis and Indians found new rare turtles at different times.
c. A turtle with chromatic leucism is insusceptible topredators.
d. Animals with albinism and leucism can bedistinguished.
e. Turtles can help humans to keep the environment healthy.
3. The paragraph following the passage will most likely discuss .…
a. research on all turtle populations
b. dangerous factors for turtle populations
c. the suggestion to look after our environment
d. turtle populations’ contribution to reduce pollution
e. some ways to save turtles from threatening factors</h2><br />
                        The third <strong>paragraph </strong>mainly discusses the endangerment of turtle populations in Nepal due to habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation, as well as the negative impacts of human activities such as the draining of wetlands for irrigation and fishing, excessive use of agrochemicals, and unsustainable fishing methods.The statement that is NOT TRUE according to the passage is (c) "A turtle with chromatic leucism is insusceptible to predators." The passage does not mention anything about the susceptibility of turtles with chromatic leucism to predators.Based on the information presented in the passage, the <strong>paragraph </strong>following the passage is most likely to discuss some ways to save turtles from the threatening factors that are negatively impacting their populations, such as habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation, and the excessive use of agrochemicals and unsustainable fishing methods.<p></p>Pembahasan<p><strong>Paragraf </strong>adalah : Kumpulan kalimat di dalam tulisan, karangan atau cerita yang di dalamnya terdapat satu ide pokok dan disertai dengan kalimat penjelas yang cara penulisannya menggunakan garis baru atau agak menjorok ke bagian dalam.</p><p></p>Pelajari Lebih LanjutMateri tentang paragraf dapat disimak juga di https://brainly.co.id/tugas/4474484<p></p><p><strong>#SPJ4</strong></p><p><strong>#UTBK</strong></p><p><strong>#SNPMB</strong></p><p><strong>#KisiKisi</strong></p><br />

It is located only about 3 km from the center of Makassar (Karebosi Park). The beach used to be the longest café in Asia, because many cafes stand in along the beach, but now the cafes are collected in a special place so it does not spread along the coast. Charm of the beach is mainly seen in the evening when the sunset stands out. This is a major attraction of people’s coming to the Losari beach. Every evening hundreds of people come to witness the panorama of red as the sun will disappear into the ocean, so do not miss the sunset at the Losari beach.

The Eiffel Tower is located on the Champ de Mars in Paris. Built in 1889, it has become both a global icon of France and one of the most recognizable building in the world.
It is the highest building in Paris and the most-visited monument in the world. Millions of people visit it every year. The engineer Gustave Eifell came up with his name for this tower. It was built as the entrance arch to the 1889 World’s Fair.
The tower is 324 meters (1,063 ft) tall, and has height as an 80-storey building. Upon its completion, it is higher than the Washington Monument to assume the title of the tallest man-made structure in the world. The title is held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York city was built in 1930. But due to the addition of antenna in 1957, the tower is now higher than the Chrysler Building and it is the second-tallest structure in France after the 2004.

The question is based on the following text.
(The story by Oiwan Lam originally appeared on Global Voices, on December 2, 2020)
Over a dozen journalists resigned on December 1 from Hong Kong Cable Television Limited, a major subscription-based TV station in Hong Kong, in protest after the media company fired 40 editorial staff in what is perceived as a political crackdown. Those laid off include the head of the China desk and the entire team of the award-winning News Lancet program. The broadcaster cited financial reasons for the layoff, a claim the newsroom staff rebukes. The entire China desk, a total of 12 people, has since resigned in protest, along with the heads of the international and finance desks and the newsroom's chief assignment editor.
The layoffs were sudden and took immediate effect — those who were sacked were told to leave the office on the same day. In shock, members of staff gathered outside the room of the news director demanding an explanation. Among those laid off is Wong Lai-ping, former deputy news editor at the China desk. On a radio interview aired on December 2, she rebuked the management's claim that the decision was made out of financial difficulties, remarking that in August, the management fired the then-executive director Fung Tak-hung and replaced him with four new managers. Wong said that the new management often made editorial requests, such as live broadcasts of China's foreign minister's regular press conference, or modifying headlines. According to Wong, the newsroom staff refused to comply with such requests.
The Hong Kong Journalists Association commented on the layoffs, "Given the [New Lancet] team’s coverage of the police and administration, it’s difficult not to see this as minimizing sensitive reporting in the name of cost-cutting".
1. Based on the text, the trigger of this resignation en masse is the belief that ….
a. the previous layoffs were politically motivated
b. financial reasons affected the layoffs the most
c. the journalists could demand for higher salary
d. political crackdown barely prompted the layoffs
e. the management's disapproved of staffs' refusal of demands
2. Dealing with the issue discussed in the text, the statement above may lead the readers to the assumption that …
a. The management’s claim should have been accepted by all parties.
b. The decision to fire Fung Tak-hung was taken with well-consideration.
c. The director Fung Tak-hung was not as competent as four new managers.
d. There was an illogical situation to claim financial difficulties as the reason for the layoffs.
e. The management tried to cover up their financial difficulties by cutting the number of employees.</h2><br />

Read the following text!
The latest round in an ongoing debate over global-warming trends claims that warming has indeed slowed down this century. An obvious slowing in the rise of global temperatures was recorded at the beginning of the twenty-first century. This was referred to as a "hiatus" or a "pause". This hiatus was first observed several years ago. Climate-change skeptics have used this as evidence that global warming has stopped permanently. But in June the previous year, a study in science claimed that the hiatus was just an artifact which disappears when biases in temperature data are corrected.
Now a prominent group of researchers is countering that claim. They argue in Nature Climate Change that even after correcting these biases the slowdown was real. "There is this mismatch between what the climate models are producing and what the observations are showing," says lead author John Fyfe. "We can't ignore it." Fyfe uses the term "slowdown" rather than "hiatus". He also stresses that it does not in any way weaken global-warming theory.
The study that questioned the existence of the slowdown corrected known biases in the surface temperature record maintained by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The finding showed differences in temperature readings from ships and buoys. This effectively increased the record about warming. The researchers also extended the record to include 2014. This set a new record high for average temperatures.
Thomas Karl, director of National Centers for Environmental Information in Asheville, calculated the rate of global warming between 1950 and 1999 as being 0.113°C per decade. This was similar to the 0.116°C a decade calculated for 2000-14. This, Karl said, meant that an assessment done by the influential Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2013 showing that warming had slowed was no longer valid.
1. The passage above mainly discusses about….
a. the hiatus observation was first carried out several years ago
b. the reason why global warming is slowing down in this century
c. global warming is a verifiable issue in the space of a decade
d. the contention about global warming and whether it is indeed slowing this period
e. the view of study in science that the hiatus is an artifact which vanishes
The word "prominent" in paragraph 2 means….
a. well-known
b. promenade
c. shrewd
d. indolent
e. magnificent
3. Why have some claimed that global warming a fabricated issue?
1. Because there’s no valid data to prove that global warming is real.
2. Since the existence of the slowdown corrected known biases in the surface temperature record upheld by the US NOAA.
3. As an assessment done on Climate Change presenting that warming had slowed was no longer valid.
4. For the researchers is countering that in Nature Climate Change even after correcting these biases the slowdown was real.

Tidak banyak yang tahu bahwa terdapat dua jenis kata kerja dalam bahasa Inggris, yakni finite dan non-finite. Dalam artikel ini, mari sama-sama kita belajar contoh finite dan non-finite verb dalam Bahasa Inggris.  </p><p>Finite verb, atau kata kerja finite, merupakan <strong>kata kerja utama dalam suatu kalimat yang biasanya tanpa auxiliary verb atau verb present participle </strong>(verb-ing). Kata kerja ini biasanya hanya ada dalam present tense atau past tense, sehingga penggunaanya cukup mudah. Contoh:</p>I go to school. (Saya pergi ke sekolah)She brings her lunch to the canteen. (Dia membawa makan siangnya ke kantin)John and Mike finish their Math task. (John dan Mike menyelesaikan tugas matematika mereka)<p>Kebalikan dari finite verb, non-finite verb merupakan <strong>kata kerja yang dalam fungsinya dapat berubah, bukan lagi menjadi kata kerja, melainkan menjadi kata sifat, kata benda, atau kata keterangan. </strong>Contoh:</p>She loves swimming (Dia suka berenang) -&gt; swim merupakan kata kerja, namun kata swimming di sini merupakan gerund. His hobbies are listening music and playing badminton (Hobinya dia adalah mendengarkan lagu dan bermain bulu tangkis) -&gt; kata listening dan playing dalam kalimat ini bukanlah kata kerja melainkan gerund.

A kangaroo is an animal found only in Australia. It has a smaller relative, called a wallaby, which lives on the Australian Island of Tasmania and in New Guinea.
Kangaroos eat grass and plants. They have short front legs, but very long and strong back legs and a tail. These are used for sitting up and for jumping. Kangaroos have been known to make forward jumps of over eight meters, and leap across fences more than three meters high. They can also run at speeds of over 45 kilometers per hour.
The largest kangaroos are the Great grey kangaroo and the Red Kangaroo. Adult grows to a length of 1.60 meters and weighs over 90 kilos.
Kangaroos are marsupials. This means that the female kangaroo has an external pouch on the front of her body. A baby kangaroo is very tiny when it is born, and it crawls at once into this pouch where it spends its first five months of life.

Read the following text!
Over the last two decades, the use of ICT has been an important topic in education. On the one hand, studies have shown that ICT can enhance teaching and learning outcomes. For example, in science and mathematics education, scholars have documented that the use of ICT can improve students’ conceptual understanding, problem solving, and team working skills. Consequently, most curriculum documents state the importance of ICT and encourage school teachers to use them. However, teachers need to specifically trained in order to integrate ICT in their teaching.
Schools are known to be resistant to innovation and change, however, the spread of ICT is beginning to affect how teachers teach. One of the current issues about the use of ICT is how it is integrated into the curriculum. The curriculum document provide arguments for introducing ICT in the school setting. Therefore, schools expect that graduates from teacher education programs have a reasonable knowledge of how to use ICT. However, this may not be the case because most current teachers’ pre-service preparation, and subsequent in-service courses were designed by using traditional educational technology and settings. Thus, the participants in these courses are not familiar with the processes, interaction patterns, features, and possibilities of teaching learning processes based on ICT.
Effective development of pre-service teachers’ ICT proficiency does not seem to be a direct process, but is the one asking for a careful, complex approach. First, a need assessment is important to find out what ICT skills and knowledge teachers need at schools. Second, designers of teacher education programs should know the pre-service teachers’ perceptions of ICT and their attitudes toward ICT integration into curriculum. Third, teacher education programs need to consider the two typical arguments that support the ICT use in schools.

a.         ICT usage has been a vital topic in education and studies indicate that ICT can develop teaching and learning upshot.
b.         Studies have shown that ICT can enrich teaching and learning end result
c.        The use of ICT has been an insignificant topic in education. Also, studies have shown that ICT can enhance teaching and learning outcomes.
d.        Over the last two decades, the use of ICT has been an important topic in educational method.
e.        Over the preceding two decades, studies have exposed that ICT can increase teaching and learning outcomes.
2.  Based on the passage, paragraph 1 most likely discusses….
a.         educational growth in the last two decades
b.         the development of education by using ICT
c.        the advantages of using ICT in the learning process
d.        teachers need to be trained in order to integrate ICT in their teaching
